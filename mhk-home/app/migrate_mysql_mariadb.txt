===== Migration from MySQL version to MariaDB version =====

From version 5.5 onwards MHK uses mariadb instead of mysql.

However if a previous mysql database is detected
and a version with mariadb was never run before,
MHK will use continue to use mysql.

If you want to migrate the database from mysql to mariadb
you can use the following commands:
   mhk use-mysql; mhk stop; mhk start
   mhk db dump
   mhk stop
   mhk use-mariadb
   mhk start
   mhk db import <dump file> # 'mhk db import' alone will list the dump files

if after the migration you have permission problems do:

   mhk db upgrade
   mhk db fix-permissions

You can always go back to the mysql version with

    mhk use-mysql
    mhk stop
    mhk start

It is recommended to use the mariadb version as the mysql version
used (5.7) is no longer maintained.
